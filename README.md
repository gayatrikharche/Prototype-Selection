# Prototype Selection for Nearest Neighbor Classification

## üìñ Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of nearest neighbor classification by selecting a representative subset of prototypes from the training set. The objective is to maintain classification performance while accelerating the search process.

### üìå Properties of Effective Prototype Sets
1. **Representativeness**: Prototypes should adequately capture the diversity and characteristics of different classes within the dataset.
2. **Robustness**: Selected prototypes must be resilient to noise and outliers to ensure stable classification.
3. **Generalization**: Prototypes should generalize well to unseen data, improving the model's ability to classify diverse examples.
4. **Efficiency**: The chosen prototypes should facilitate faster search times without significantly compromising accuracy.

## üîç Prototype Selection Methods
Several methods can be employed for prototype selection, each with its distinct characteristics:

1. **K-Means Clustering**: 
   - Identify centroids representing different clusters in the dataset. 
   - Select prototypes based on these centroids.

2. **Modified Condensed Nearest Neighbors (MCNN)**: 
   - Iteratively flag and remove misclassified instances.
   - Add representative centroids of misclassified examples from each class to the prototype set.

3. **Reduced Nearest Neighbors (RNN)**: 
   - Remove instances from the training set if their removal does not lead to misclassification.
   - Create a subset ensuring classification accuracy.

4. **Generalized Condensed Nearest Neighbor (GCNN)**: 
   - Employ a voting mechanism to select initial prototypes.
   - Apply the CNN rule, considering class and distance criteria, to refine the prototype set.
